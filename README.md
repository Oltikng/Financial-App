# Financial-App
- This Project Application uses ASP.NET Core Authentication and Authorization, by sending confirmation link to the users email upon Registration.
- Registration Data is saved on a local Database using MSSQL application
- After confirmation of the address, User now can Log-In using its personalized email and password
- When entering the Home page User can create wallets and view monthly balance with graphics and other UI-personalization for that page
- Transactions module allows users to create their hourly income and expenses, also categorizing them into services
- For security reasons SMTP Email configurations are hidden

Project is still going development, new updates will be comming soon!!
